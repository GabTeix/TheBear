# TheBear
.NET Devirtualizer for NashaVM that I made for nothing.

## How to use?
Just drag and drop the file in TheBear.exe

## Why TheBear?
I associate Nasha to Masha, and masha reminds the the drawing I saw in childhood, masha and the bear.

## Why did you make this project?
Just because I have nothing better to do

## Will have updates?
Yes, I will update it when I want, but probably I will update each time they update.
